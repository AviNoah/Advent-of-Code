# First line is input to traverse graph
# Next lines are the definition of a node network, Node = (Left_child, Right_child)
# Start at Node AAA, according to the RL inputs, traverse either left or right in every node

# Performing this sequence for a certain number of periods P, will eventually land you on ZZZ
# So the total steps are P * len(input)

# Find total steps
